# Workspace
This repository demonstrates how to create a workspace container using Docker. The purpose of a workspace container is to have an image with all the personal tools and programs you are using to be a productive developer. This has several advantages:
1. To have your personal setup ready to use you can just pull and run an image.
1. You do not need to remember all the required steps to install all of your tooling. It is documented in the Dockerfile.
1. You can experiment without messing with your OS.
1. You are learning how to use Docker.
